# Animalia Classification Model in JavaScript:

## Overview

This JavaScript project implements a classification system for the Kingdom Animalia. It categorizes animals based on two key characteristics: whether they are cold-blooded or warm-blooded, and whether they have a backbone or not. The code employs object-oriented programming principles to create a hierarchical structure for various animal classes.

### Classes

1. **Animal**
The Animal class serves as the base class, encapsulating general properties and behaviors shared by all animals. It includes properties for cold-bloodedness, the presence of a backbone, and an abstract method for sound production (sound). Additionally, it implements a default method for movement (move), showcasing polymorphism.

2. **Specific Animal Classes**
***Arthropoda***
Represents animals without a backbone that are cold-blooded, such as insects and spiders.
Inherits from the Animal class and provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods (sound and move).
Includes specific properties and behaviors unique to arthropods.
***Fish***
Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone.
Extends the Animal class, inheriting its properties and behaviors.
Provides specific implementations for the abstract methods related to fish characteristics.
***Amphibia***
Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone, including frogs and salamanders.
Inherits from the Animal class and extends its functionality.
Implements unique properties and behaviors for amphibians.
***Reptiles***
Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone, such as snakes and turtles.
Inherits from Animal and extends its functionalities.
Defines specific traits and behaviors for reptiles.
***Aves (Birds)***
Represents warm-blooded animals with a backbone.
Extends the Animal class to inherit shared properties and behaviors.
Implements specific methods and properties for birds, showcasing the diversity in the animal kingdom.
***Mammals***
Represents warm-blooded animals with a backbone.
Inherits from the Animal class, building upon its properties and methods.
Provides distinct implementations for mammalian characteristics.

### Example Usage
The code includes an example usage section, demonstrating how to create instances of the various animal classes and invoke their methods. It showcases the versatility of the implemented classification system and how different animals exhibit unique behaviors based on their classification.

Feel free to explore the code, create your instances, and observe the diverse characteristics of animals in the Kingdom Animalia.
