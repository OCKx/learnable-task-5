# Animalia Classification Model in JavaScript

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple JavaScript implementation of the Classification for Kingdom Animalia. It models different groups of animals based on whether they are cold-blooded or warm-blooded and whether they have a backbone or not.

## Classes

### 1. Animal

The `Animal` class is the base class representing generic animal characteristics. It has properties for cold-bloodedness and the presence of a backbone. The class also includes methods for movement (`move`) and sound production (`sound`), utilizing polymorphism and abstraction.

### 2. Specific Animal Classes

- **Arthropoda:** Represents animals without a backbone that are cold-blooded, such as insects and spiders.
- **Fish:** Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone.
- **Amphibia:** Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone, like frogs and salamanders.
- **Reptiles:** Represents cold-blooded animals with a backbone, including snakes and turtles.
- **Aves (Birds):** Represents warm-blooded animals with a backbone.
- **Mammals:** Represents warm-blooded animals with a backbone.
